# Expert Amp Server — Protocol Notes

This document captures what we currently understand about the SPE Expert amplifier binary protocol, how we decode it, and what remains uncertain or unverified.

Primary sources for protocol work are:
- captured behavior from the real amp
- the vendor `SPE_Application_Programmers_Guide.pdf` (especially section 5, "The String Status", pages 8 to 10 in the current PDF)
- the reverse-engineering notes in this repo

**Read this before touching the decoder, the character map, the attribute model, or anything that claims to know what the amp is saying.**

Captured behavior from the real amp wins over documents, notes, and reasonable-seeming assumptions. When something is a hypothesis rather than a confirmed observation, this document says so explicitly.

---

## Authority order and distinct concerns

For amp status, keep the authority order explicit:

1. **Protocol-native vendor status poll data is authoritative** when the documented status poll/response path is available.
2. **Display-derived telemetry is fallback data** for fields the status poll does not currently provide, or when protocol-native status is temporarily unavailable.
3. **Rendered display state and parsed screen text are never the canonical machine-readable contract.** They are useful for UI mirroring, debugging, and conservative fallback extraction.

Protocol work touches four separate things that are easy to conflate. Keep them distinct:

### 1. Rendered display state

**What it is:** The 8×40 grid of character and attribute bytes that describes what the amp's LCD is currently showing.

**How we get it:** A binary frame arrives over USB/serial. We decode it into `display.State{Chars[8][40], Attrs[40]}`. The state is purely presentational — it is what the screen looks like, not what the amp "is" in an operational sense.

**Where it lives:** `internal/display` (model), `internal/protocol` (decoder).

**Key point:** The display state does not directly contain values like "power = 350W." It contains characters and pixels that, when rendered, show "350W" somewhere on the screen. Telemetry extraction is a separate step.

---

### 2. Parsed text

**What it is:** A plain-text extraction of the display state — the characters read off the screen row by row, trimmed of trailing whitespace.

**How we get it:** `protocol.ScreenText(frame)` calls `StateFromFrame` then joins the rows.

**Example output from `real_home_status_frame.bin` (approximate):**
```
SOLID STATE
FULLY AUTOMATIC
STANDBY
...
```

**Where it lives:** `protocol.ScreenText` and `protocol.FrameMeta.ScreenText`.

**Key point:** Parsed text is useful for quick human review and debugging. It is not the same as telemetry — you would need to parse field positions and label patterns out of the text to extract structured values. We have not done that systematically yet.

---

### 3. Structured status and telemetry

**What it is:** Structured values extracted from the amp state, band, power output, SWR, TX state, alarms, ATU state, and related fields, in a form that API consumers can use directly without parsing LCD text themselves.

**Current status:** We now have two related structured surfaces:
- `GET /api/v1/status` is the canonical automation status surface.
- `GET /api/v1/telemetry` is the current runtime telemetry snapshot, still useful, but not the authority when protocol-native status poll data exists.

**Authoritative path:** the vendor Programmer's Guide explicitly documents a separate status poll command (`55 55 55 01 90 90`) and a fixed-length ASCII CSV status response frame (`AA AA AA 43 ...`) for monitoring. That documented status poll is the primary source of truth for machine-readable amp state.

**Display role:** display parsing still matters, but as a fallback and supplement. It is appropriate for rendered UI state, debugging, and filling gaps when the status payload does not yet provide a field or current implementation has not surfaced it yet.

**Current implementation reality:** the documented status response is parsed for `/api/v1/status`, but the exported contract is still intentionally conservative. We should not claim fields the implementation does not actually emit yet, even when the guide suggests they belong in the long-term model.

**Specific guidance from the documented status payload:**
- model number should come from the status payload identifier bytes when available
- standby vs operate should come from the status payload state byte when available
- fields documented on Programmer's Guide pages 9 and 10 should be represented in status updates where supported by the implementation
- band exposes both the raw status code and a decoded text form (`bandText`)
- warnings and alarms preserve raw status codes and also expose decoded text fields (`warningsText`, `alarmsText`)
- documented status meter fields should surface as first-class API fields instead of leaking through `notes`, using raw-plus-decoded or parsed-plus-display pairs where the guide/current captures justify them

The documented status response supplies temperature numbers without a unit marker. `amplifierTemperatureUnit` must match the amplifier's SET-menu selection. The serial ingest boundary converts those readings to canonical Celsius for `temperatureC`, lower/combiner `*C` fields, safety monitoring, and fan thresholds. Operator-facing display fields retain the configured amplifier unit.

**Where it lives:** `internal/api/types.go`, `internal/protocol/status.go`, `internal/runtime/status_state.go`, the HTTP handlers serving `/api/v1/status`, and the OpenAPI artifact served from `/api/v1/openapi.json`.

---

### 4. Action transport

**What it is:** The mechanism for sending button presses or other commands to the amp over the serial/USB connection.

**Current status:** `POST /api/v1/actions/button` is the canonical route for documented front-panel button commands, with `POST /api/actions/button` retained as a compatibility alias. Separately, `POST /api/v1/actions/wake` is the canonical route for the experimental amp wake/power-on path that toggles DTR/RTS on the FTDI serial control lines. More broadly, the canonical REST surface for machine-readable clients now lives under `/api/v1/...`; older non-v1 routes are compatibility aliases or legacy debug helpers. Supported document-backed button names are encoded and written to the live serial transport when one is configured. If no live button transport is available, the server returns `503` with `button transport unavailable`. Actions that remain intentionally blocked on the button endpoint (such as `back`, `on`, and `standby`) return `400`; `on` stays blocked there because wake is not honest to model as a normal front-panel button.

The safety controller has one deliberately narrow active path. When monitoring and `overtemperatureStandbyArmed` are enabled, fresh protocol-native status says OPERATE and RX, and the hottest sensor reaches the trip threshold, it sends the documented OPERATE command exactly once to request STANDBY. The write is reported sent/unconfirmed. It never acts during TX, retries automatically, powers off, or wakes the amplifier.

Fan-policy control is separate and disabled by default. Manual Normal or CONTEST requests and automatic hysteresis use the same display-verified transaction. Production writes support the hardware-verified First Series Expert 1.3K-FA and CONFIG-first Second Series Expert 1.5K-FA model-bound topologies; unsupported models stop before SET. When necessary the controller requests STANDBY and verifies newer protocol and LCD evidence before entering the menu. It verifies every TEMP/FANS and SAVE waypoint, pauses all writes and the ordinary waypoint timeout during TX, and restores OPERATE only after verified completion when it owned the transition. An unexpected screen or stale state fails closed.

The navigation receipt retains the newest 32 exact verified semantic waypoints, suppresses consecutive duplicates, and reports whether bounded DISPLAY recovery was attempted plus the recognized setup waypoint it exited. The trace never stores raw LCD content, preserves the terminal home waypoint, and resets when a replacement transaction begins.

Controlled testing on the First Series Expert 1.3K-FA established that serial DISPLAY exits its setup menu without saving and returns to STANDBY/RX home. Adrian's established delayed DISPLAY recovery on the promoted Expert 1.5K-FA Second Series likewise returns its exact setup grid to STANDBY home, and an August 2026 startup test confirmed that the stranded BEEP screen occurs only while automatic fan verification is active. Unattended startup verification may therefore send DISPLAY exactly once after a mismatch or timeout only while the controller is actively traversing one of those profiles' own exact setup-grid waypoints. A timeout after a pending RIGHT move within that grid is eligible; stale evidence from before SET entered a submenu is not. Recovery retains the actuation lease and requires a newer checksum-valid STANDBY/RX home frame. It does not mark verification successful, never retries, and is unavailable from submenus, cross-family or unknown screens, TX or unknown RX state, other models, and manual/API transactions. The broader Second Series Menu Debug fan-submenu no-save exit remains blocked because this evidence covers only its exact top-level startup setup grid.

Menu Debug & Reporting is a separate disabled-by-default discovery boundary. Arming requires the exact acknowledgement, fresh protocol STANDBY/RX, a recent checksum-valid STANDBY home display, inactive fan control, disarmed overtemperature standby, and an exclusive actuation lease. Its token is memory-only and short-lived; each mutation consumes the latest revision so stale tabs cannot replay commands. The built-in wizard requests only the fan capability; bank topology remains available only when an API client explicitly requests it, so completed fan validation cannot silently continue into unrelated bank discovery. One guarded start runs discovery and the frozen apply plan automatically, but every SET, RIGHT, or model-specific no-save exit still receives one authorization and waits for a newer matching checksum-valid screen before the next authorization. Apply pauses for physical candidate confirmation; a positive answer starts automatic restore, followed by physical restored confirmation. Protocol status, LCD evidence, discovery and planned authorizations are bound to the observed amplifier model and the serial-session generation that produced them. The live transport atomically requires that same model, STANDBY, and known RX under its write lock before sending. Opening a replacement port or observing a different identified model within the same port session immediately invalidates the entire active session and discards all report evidence, preventing different hardware from continuing or relabeling prior evidence; the transport also captures the verified port under its write lock so a reconnect cannot redirect a command.

Reviewed reversible fan-test grammars cover the First Series Expert 1.3K-FA, CONFIG-first Expert 1.5K-FA Second Series, and exact Expert 2K-FA Third Series topologies. Third Series production is narrower: it requires model `EXPERT 2K-FA`, exact captured topology, and an operator-declared actual firmware value exactly equal to `Rel.26_03_24_A` or `Rel.08_06_26_A` because status polling does not expose firmware. Empty, mistyped, case-variant, and all other firmware values fail closed. It is STANDBY/RX-only, maps hardware QUIET to logical Normal and hardware NORMAL to logical high cooling, and never sends DISPLAY or an OPERATE/STANDBY command. Unknown models and F-KFA NORMAL/QUIET layouts remain topology-only; QUIET is never interpreted as high cooling.

An August 2026 Third Series Expert 2K-FA field report established a separate menu family. Its home header has `CAT` where bank-capable models have `BNK`, its setup grid separates `TEMP.` from `FAN NOISE`, and its fan page is a NORMAL/QUIET radio group headed `POWER-SUPPLY FAN`. The raw `0xAE` glyph marks the active radio value and is read from the exact character grid rather than inferred from decoded text. Production D1 report `00acd5279f994baf497f58cf607f9efea6b770fbf3679beae301a88ce177b715` completed the guarded NORMAL→QUIET→NORMAL apply/restore run with newer SAVE/home receipts and positive physical verification. Its 23 distinct exact raw states are checked in as regression fixtures. No report evidence authorizes OPERATE-to-STANDBY automation.

After upgrading to `Rel.08_06_26_A`, the same operator separately re-captured the top setup grid and FAN NOISE page/cursor topology read-only and reported them exactly unchanged. That narrower evidence supports the same exact production recognizer on the newer firmware, but it is not represented as another complete NORMAL→QUIET→NORMAL report and does not replace or relabel the original D1 provenance.

The same field report disproved a broader no-save assumption. On that firmware, top-level items whose legend says `[SET]:CHANGE` write immediately; DISPLAY cannot undo the change. Sub-pages with an explicit SAVE stage their edits, but that does not make DISPLAY a globally safe recovery key. Per-page legends and model-scoped capture evidence therefore remain authoritative before SET, and DISPLAY recovery remains explicitly allowlisted by model and screen.

For cross-model topology collection, an otherwise unreviewed setup screen may enter a highlighted fan candidate only when its live legend contains `[SET]:CONFIRM`. A `[SET]:CHANGE` legend blocks entry before SET because it may be an immediate persistent write. After confirmed entry, a page containing a FAN label, explicit SAVE item, selector legend, and SET legend can be retained as candidate-only evidence even when its wording and values are new. Broader recognition does not authorize selector movement inside that page, value changes, SAVE, or DISPLAY recovery. The actuation lease remains held until a newer checksum-valid STANDBY home screen is observed after the operator physically exits the menu.

An accepted same-session status frame whose model identifier is empty or unknown preserves the controller's last identified model solely for in-flight receipt and report attribution. The live transport tracks that frame's current identity independently and rejects every new write until a later protocol status identifies the expected model again.

Only reviewed server-owned action profiles may propose a reversible value change and SAVE. Unknown models and layouts are topology-only. Any mismatch, TX observation, stale evidence, timeout, abort, transport failure, or safety preemption stops fail-closed, releases ownership, and leaves physical-panel recovery to the operator. TX observations are latched immediately, abort is serialized against final dispatch, no command is blindly retried, and the wizard never restores OPERATE. `menu-report.v2` contains normalized display evidence, exact raw 8x40 character and attribute grids, fingerprints, action/transition receipts, and operator verification while excluding host, network, callsign, session-token, and serial-device identity. Ordinary failure, abort, and expiry retain an explicitly incomplete local diagnostic report; incomplete reports cannot be uploaded. Completed-report upload is explicit and one-shot, and reports remain candidate evidence for maintainer review rather than automatic permission to change production behavior.

Vendor-documented backlight commands `0x82` and `0x83` are exposed as `backlight-on` and `backlight-off`. Their user-visible effects still need broader model testing.

**Where it lives:** `internal/api/types.go`, `internal/transport/buttons.go`, `internal/runtime/serial_source.go`, `internal/server/server.go`, `cmd/server/main.go`.

**Open question:** Which documented direct-button effects and fan-menu waypoints vary across models and firmware?

## What we know about the display frame format

### Header

Every display frame we have captured starts with the same historical 8-byte stream prefix:

```
AA AA AA 6A 01 95 FE 01
```

For 371-byte GetLCD responses, the first seven bytes are the real fixed header (`AA AA AA 6A 01 95 FE`) and byte 7 is also the first byte of the inverted flag word. Current checked-in 371-byte captures both have that low flag byte as `0x01`, so they still match the historical 8-byte prefix used by the stream decoder.

`IsRadioDisplayFrame` accepts both the fully recognized GetLCD response shape and the older 8-byte-prefix display captures.

**Status: confirmed from current real captures, but stream boundary detection should eventually move from the historical 8-byte prefix to the stronger length/checksum shape if other flag values change byte 7.**

### GetLCD response layout and body offset

The 371-byte captures (`real_home_status_frame.bin` and `sample_display_frame.bin`) match the reported response to the `0x80` GetLCD request:

```
[0..2]     sync preamble: AA AA AA
[3..4]     little-endian payload length: 0x016A = 362 bytes
[5..6]     unknown/status bytes: 95 FE
[7..8]     2-byte flag word, inverted little-endian
[9..328]   320-byte display body: 8 rows × 40 cols, one byte per cell
[329..368] 40-byte packed attribute/highlight bitplane
[369..370] 16-bit little-endian checksum over bytes [7..368] (flags + LCD payload)
```

The display body starts at byte 9 for those frames. `LCDDataOffset` recognizes this length/checksum shape and returns 9. Live stream frames may be longer than 371 bytes when a status-poll response arrives before the next display prefix; the display parser still treats the leading 371 bytes as the GetLCD response and ignores the trailing bytes for LCD payload and checksum purposes. Older 299-byte menu/panel captures also decode correctly at byte 9 but do not include the full GetLCD length/checksum tail, so they do not expose parsed flags.

`GuessDisplayStart` remains as a diagnostic text-scoring heuristic only; it is not used for decoding.

**Status: layout confirmed for the 371-byte home capture and structurally matched by `sample_display_frame.bin`; `real_home_status_frame.bin` checksum validates. `sample_display_frame.bin` carries the same length/offset shape but its checksum does not match the same sum rule, so treat its trailing checksum/flag truth as suspect.**

### LCD flags

`LCDFlagsFromFrame` preserves the raw inverted little-endian flag word and the decoded value (`raw ^ 0xffff`) for 371-byte GetLCD responses. Current fixture values:

| File | Raw inverted flags | Decoded flags | Checksum | Screen evidence |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| `real_home_status_frame.bin` | `0xf801` | `0x07fe` | valid | Standby screen |
| `sample_display_frame.bin` | `0x3301` | `0xccfe` | invalid under the confirmed sum rule | sample/proto text says Standby |

Andrew G0RVM reported that the flag word includes front-panel LED state. Live captures on an Expert 1.3K-FA validated several decoded high bits. The API exposes these under `lcdFlags.leds` only when the GetLCD checksum is valid; canonical machine-readable status still comes from the protocol status poll first.

| LED/state | decoded bit | validation |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| OP / operate | `0x1000` | Captured standby → operate; only this bit changed. |
| SET / setup menu | `0x2000` | Captured standby → setup menu; only this bit changed. |
| TUNE | `0x4000` | Captured burst during tune timeout; only this bit changed. |
| TX | `0x0800` | Confirmed through repeated checksum-valid RX → TX → RX captures on a First Series Expert 1.3K-FA. |

These LED bits are intended for the amp-shaped Front Panel template because they mirror the physical panel indicators more directly than status fields. They are not a replacement for the richer `/api/v1/status` data.

For protocol work, start the server with `-lcd-flag-debug` to log checksum-valid changes in unknown decoded flag bits. The log includes the unknown mask, full decoded/raw words, known LED states, and the first display line. This is opt-in so normal installs do not spam logs.

### Character encoding

Each character cell is a single byte. `DecodeDisplayChar` maps byte values:

| Byte range | Decoded as |
|---|---|
| `0x00` | Space |
| `0x01`–`0x1F` | Letters A–Z (offset by 1: `0x01` → `A`, `0x02` → `B`, …) |
| `0x20`–`0x5F` | Direct ASCII (printable range: space through `_`) |
| `0x8D`, `0x8E`, `0x8F`, `0xA0`–`0xA3` | `0x80` (routed to custom glyph bank) |
| All others | `·` (placeholder, unknown/unmapped) |

**Status: partially confirmed.** The A–Z mapping and the direct ASCII range work on current fixtures. The upper-byte glyph codes (`0x8x`, `0xAx`) are placeholder mappings for LCD-specific symbols — they render something, but whether the rendered glyphs match the real hardware characters has not been verified.

### Attribute bytes

The 40 bytes after the 320 display cells are decoded as a column-major highlight bitplane: one byte per column, with bit `r` (LSB = row 0) marking row `r` in that column as highlighted/reverse-video.

**Status: supported by the current fixture/rendering work and regression tests for menu-style highlights, but broader model/firmware validation is still useful.**

---

## Display model

Once decoded, the display is an 8-row × 40-column grid of bytes. Each cell holds one character code. Rendering is deterministic: given the same `display.State` and `font.ROM`, the output is always the same.

The model is symmetric: the diff operation (`display.Compare`) checks both character and attribute bytes per cell, producing a list of changed cells. This is the foundation for efficient incremental UI updates once live ingest is wired.

---

## Fixture files

The `fixtures/` directory contains real binary frames captured from hardware. These are the ground truth for decoder development and regression testing.

### What's there

| File | Description | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `real_home_status_frame.bin` | Home/status screen | 371 bytes |
| `real_menu_frame.bin` | Menu screen | 299 bytes |
| `real_panel_frame.bin` | Panel/control screen | 299 bytes |
| `sample_display_frame.bin` | Another status screen capture | 371 bytes |

All four start with the known `AA AA AA 6A 01 95 FE 01` header.

### Rules for using fixtures

**Do not modify the fixture files.** They are captured hardware output. Modifying them breaks regression value.

**Do not add synthetic fixtures.** A constructed binary that "looks like" a frame is not a fixture — it is a test vector. Keep them separate.

**Do add new real captures.** If you have access to the amp and capture new frames, add them to `fixtures/` with a descriptive name. Document what the screen was showing at capture time in a comment in the fixture-loading code or a `fixtures/README.md`.

**Use fixtures for regression tests.** When changing the decoder, write tests that load these files and assert on `ScreenText` output or specific cell values. Do not rely on manual visual inspection of renders as the only verification.

**If a fixture produces unexpected output, investigate before changing the decoder.** The fixture may be revealing something the current decoder gets wrong. That is the fixture doing its job.

### How fixtures flow into the server

At startup, `cmd/server/main.go` loads all three named fixtures:

```go
fixtures := map[string]string{
    "home":  "fixtures/real_home_status_frame.bin",
    "menu":  "fixtures/real_menu_frame.bin",
    "panel": "fixtures/real_panel_frame.bin",
}
```

Each is decoded via `protocol.LoadFixtureState`. If decoding fails, the fixture is silently skipped and the demo state is used as fallback. A decode failure at startup should be treated as a regression if it appears after a decoder change.

---

## Open questions and known gaps

These are things we do not yet know. Do not paper over them with assumptions.

1. **Cross-model LCD TX flag validation.** The LCD `0x0800` TX bit is confirmed on a First Series Expert 1.3K-FA. Other amplifier models still need their own confirmation.

2. **Additional structured frames beyond the documented status poll.** We know the vendor-documented status poll exists. What we do not yet know is whether the amp also sends other structured non-display frames over the same serial connection that are worth decoding separately.

3. **Button effects across models.** The command table and framing are implemented, but broader model-by-model confirmation remains useful.

4. **Glyph mapping accuracy.** The bundled SPE-style LCD font table and any project-authored glyph handling should continue to be checked against real hardware captures.

5. **Multiple display families.** Different Expert models or firmware revisions may have different frame structures. We have only a small number of hardware sources so far.

6. **Frame boundary detection.** The stream decoder now recognizes the 371-byte GetLCD response boundary before falling back to prefix-based splitting, so trailing status-poll bytes should not be swallowed by display frames. Keep regression captures for mixed display/status streams.

7. **Upper-byte character codes.** Byte values above `0x5F` that are not in the known special-glyph set decode to `·`. Some of these likely correspond to real LCD symbols we have not mapped yet.

---

## What to do when captures disagree with code

This is the expected state. The code was written from partial information.

When real captured frames produce wrong output:

1. Keep the fixture. It is now evidence.
2. Document what the frame shows on real hardware (photo or description).
3. Update the decoder to match, not the fixture to match the decoder.
4. Update this document to reflect the new understanding, including what was wrong before.
5. Add a regression test so the fix is permanent.

**Do not guess.** If you cannot determine the correct behavior from available captures, document the uncertainty here and flag it for the next capture session.
